## Setup

this project is setup with Laravel and react using vite. I consumed the Star Wars API (SWAPI) for this project. documentation here: https://swapi.dev/documentation

- at the root level run composer update
- add MySQL credentials to .env file
- run PHP artisan migrate
- CD into the react sub directory and run npm i
- start the backend API with php arisan serve
- start the front end with npm run dev


## What's next?

I tried my best to hold to 4 hrs on this project and obviously some requested functionality is missing.

- Adding and managing favorites on the front end ( the API end points for this exist but I did not get to implement them on the front end)
- major styling updates are needed on the front end
- there are a few nitpicky thorns that are eating at me, but I will let you find those yourselves

Where this project is currently I would be looking for another 3 hours to add a new front end component for managing favorites, I do not expect many unforseen issues to come from that process making lists like this is something I have a lot of experience in
